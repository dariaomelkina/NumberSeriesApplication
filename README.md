# Number Series Application
## Description
An application for calculating series partial sum and
determining if a series is convergent or not convergent.
## Details:
To check convergence application uses:
* needed condition of convergence
* Cauchy test
* d'Alembert test
* harmonic series convergence test

To calculate partial sum, in some cases it uses stack implementation and Polish notation.

The key prerequisity is using **sympy** library.
## Usage:
The application is launched from the **main** module, which contains gui.

Left entry frame is for series nth element.
Result of the convergence testing is displayed in the left scrolled text frame.

Right entry frame is for n in nth partial sum of the same series.
Result of the partial sum calculation is displayed in the right scrolled text frame.
## Prerequisites:
``` pip install sympy ```
